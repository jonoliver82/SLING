## SLING: ARM Simulator

This project was created in 2008 as part of my university course. 

It has been updated to build in Visual Studio 2015 targeting .NET 4.5.2, and the Unit Test project
changed from NUnit 2.4.6.0 to MSTest.

The source code remains as is, in need of much refactoring.

### Build Environment
The application has been built on Windows Vista, using Microsoft Visual Studio.
Visual Stuido 2005 was used first, then 2008 when it was released.
